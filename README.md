# Gob (Generic OBject)
`gob` provides a generic object for Ruby with lots and lots of yummy syntactic sugar, great for storing settings or options and the like. I'm sure there are other fantastic uses for it, too! There has to be, right?

### Installation
`gem install gob`

Or add it to your Gemfile. It's really that simple. I mean, I hope it is. Let me know if it's not!
